# node Safety Dashboard

**🏭 AI-Powered Warehouse Safety Incident Monitoring**

A modern, premium warehouse safety incident monitoring dashboard. Real-time incident tracking, video evidence, and intelligent alerting for warehouse managers and safety teams.

---

## 📋 Overview

**node** transforms warehouse safety by providing real-time visibility into safety incidents. The dashboard displays incidents across three main categories:

- **MHE Too Close** - Materials Handling Equipment proximity violations
- **No High-Vis** - Workers without proper safety gear detected
- **Walkway Zone** - Unauthorized personnel in restricted areas

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Start development server
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the dashboard.

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Edit `.env` with your configuration:

```env
# API Endpoints (Update with your AWS API Gateway URLs)
REACT_APP_API_INCIDENTS_URL=https://your-api.amazonaws.com/incidents
REACT_APP_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name

# Optional: AWS Authentication (for future use)
REACT_APP_ENABLE_AUTH=false

# Performance
REACT_APP_AUTO_REFRESH_INTERVAL=10000
```

### API Integration

The dashboard is production-ready for AWS API integration:

**Expected API Response:**
```json
{
  "incidents": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "video_url": "string (S3 URL or MP4 path)",
      "date": "2026-02-07",
      "time": "14:32:45",
      "location": "Warehouse Floor - Zone A",
      "safety_event_type": "no-high-vis | mhe-close | walkway-zoning",
      "description": "string",
      "duration": "3.2s"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Connect your API:**
1. Update `REACT_APP_API_INCIDENTS_URL` in `.env`
2. Modify `src/services/mockData.js` → replace mock data with actual API calls
3. Uncomment auto-refresh interval in `IncidentDashboard.jsx`

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed integration guide.
